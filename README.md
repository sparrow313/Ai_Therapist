## üì± Core Features Deep Dive

### Motivation System
The app's core strength lies in its adaptive motivation system:

```typescript
// Three distinct motivation styles
type MotivationStyle = 'positive' | 'goal-oriented' | 'tough-love';

// Dynamic message categories
type MessageCategory = 'daily' | 'milestone' | 'craving' | 'relapse' | 'progress';
```

Each style provides different approaches to the same recovery goals:
- **Positive**: Supportive, encouraging language
- **Goal-oriented**: Metrics-focused, achievement-based
- **Tough-love**: Direct, challenging, accountability-focused

- **Daily Check-ins**: Required daily pledges to maintain streaks
- **Social Pressure**: Community visibility of progress

### Community Integration
- **Anonymous Sharing**: Safe space for recovery stories
